        "In a past project developing a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform, the primary ethical focus was on user engagement and click-through rates. Reflecting on this, I see a missed opportunity to embed ethical AI principles from the start. For any future project, I would implement the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "First, I would conduct a** \"Fairness by Design\"** audit before writing any code. This involves mapping the system's potential impact on different user groups and proactively identifying sources of bias in the data. For a recommender system, this could mean ensuring that products from diverse or small sellers are not unfairly suppressed by the algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Second, I would prioritize **Transparency and Explainability**. Instead of a \"black box\" model, I would use techniques like SHAP or LIME to provide users with simple explanations like \"You're seeing this because you liked X.\" Furthermore, I would create a public-facing page explaining the system's core functionality, its goals, and what user data it uses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, I would build in **continuous monitoring**. I would track fairness metrics (like demographic parity in recommendation rates) alongside performance metrics in a live dashboard. This ensures that if the model develops drift or starts to exhibit biased behavior post-deployment, it can be caught and corrected promptly, upholding the principles of non-maleficence and justice."
